<p>* Noted: I fulfilled the project by web-scraping the 3000 vacabularies and storing them into a database. You don't have to do web-scraping and store to a database again, so I have commentted the code for this action out.</p>

<h3>How to play:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Once you type the first character of the first(top-left) word in the text box, the timer starts to count down.</li>
  <li>Only the correct character is accepted and going to show in the text box.</li>
  <li>Once all the characters of a word your're typing are done, hit "Space" to turn to the next word.</li>
  <li>Keep typing the words until the timer runs out. And your typing speed, i.e., CPM(characters per minute) and WPM(words per minute), can be checked on the screen.</li>
  <li>You can restart at any time, it will reset the timer, the vocabularies, and the typing speeds.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Other headsup:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Don't hit "Backward" when you typed wrongly becasue the incorrect typed character won;t be accepted, or your previous character should be deleted.</li>
  <li>When you type the correct character, the word you are typing will be hightlighted in a green background. E.g.,
    <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2598e4b-d558-4d36-b691-4b80e7500138"></li>
  <li>Otherwise, when you type the incorrect character, the word you are typing will be hightlighted in a red background. E.g.,
    <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6324c30-dad3-410a-a317-14775c302c95"></li>
  <li>When the word is done and "Space" is hit, the word should be hightlighted in blue and with gray background. E.g.,
    <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f373e1a4-062f-41e2-a389-d139b7f213bd"></li>
  <li>You can not type anything if the time's up.</li>
  <li>Don't worry about your fast typing speed, the words will turn to a new page if you finish all the words shown now.</li>
</ol>
